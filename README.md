# python-basic-matplot-numpy-panda-scipy-tkinter

Here are some practice codes about PYTHON BASIC, MATPLOT, NUMPY, PANDA, SCIPY, TKINTER. 
I've added the necessary files, datasets, and models to the data-folder.
Download the data-folder from [google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iLzKOxKpJ305jUhma49uauDGWNQJz9In/view?usp=sharing). 
Chnage data-directory in source code according to your folder location.
